        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Revision: October 26, 2023</p>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document outlines the official Refund Policy ("Policy") for all digital products and services purchased through accessnode.cc (the "Site"). As a provider of digital, non-tangible goods, our refund policy is necessarily strict to protect our intellectual property and prevent abuse. This Policy is a component of our main Terms of Service and is binding on all users who make a purchase on our Site.</p>
        <p>We urge you to read this Policy carefully and in its entirety before completing any transaction. By making a purchase, you are explicitly agreeing to the terms laid out herein. Please be aware that consumer protection laws regarding digital content may vary by jurisdiction, and this Policy is constructed to be compliant with major international regulations for digital goods.</p>

        <h2>2. Scope of Application</h2>
        <p>This Refund Policy applies exclusively to all paid digital products offered directly by Z1-Gray through the accessnode.cc website. These products are defined as, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Digital structured guidance systems and frameworks.</li>
            <li>Downloadable documents, including reports, guides, and worksheets in PDF or other digital formats.</li>
            <li>Access to online courses, video content, or interactive digital programs.</li>
            <li>Activation codes or license keys for software or digital platforms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This Policy does not apply to any physical merchandise, third-party products or services that may be linked from our Site, or any purchases made through reseller platforms or app stores that are not directly controlled by accessnode.cc. Such purchases would be subject to the refund policies of the respective third-party platform.</p>

        <h2>3. Nature of Our Products</h2>
        <p>It is crucial for all users to understand the inherent nature of the products we provide. Every product available on accessnode.cc is a <strong>digital good</strong>. This means they are non-tangible, delivered instantly upon payment confirmation, and cannot be "returned" in the traditional sense. Once a digital product is downloaded or accessed, it is permanently in the user's possession and we cannot revoke that access or verify its deletion.</p>
        <p>The delivery is considered complete at the moment the digital product is made available to you, which may occur via:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A direct download link provided on the post-purchase screen.</li>
            <li>An email sent to your provided address containing access or download instructions.</li>
            <li>The activation of access to a members-only area or online course platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given this immediate and irreversible fulfillment, our products are classified as digital services for which performance has begun with the consumer's prior express consent and their acknowledgment that they thereby lose their right of withdrawal.</p>

        <h2>4. Legal Basis for Non-Refundable Policy</h2>
        <p>Our non-refundable policy is based on established international legal frameworks that recognize the unique nature of digital content. The standard consumer "cooling-off period" or right of withdrawal is typically waived for digital products where performance (i.e., download or access) begins immediately.</p>
        <p>Specifically, our policy aligns with provisions such as <strong>Article 16(m) of the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU)</strong>. This directive exempts "the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the consumer's prior express consent and his acknowledgment that he thereby loses his right of withdrawal."</p>
        <p>Similarly, consumer protection laws in other jurisdictions, including the United States (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act - CCPA), generally do not mandate refunds for non-returnable, irrevocable digital goods that have been delivered as described.</p>
        <div class="disclaimer-box">
            <h3>Waiver of Right to Withdraw</h3>
            <p><strong>By proceeding with the purchase, accessing, or downloading any digital product from accessnode.cc, you explicitly acknowledge and agree that you waive your right to withdraw from the purchase under applicable consumer protection laws. You understand that because performance begins immediately, the sale is final and non-refundable.</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>5. Refund Denial Policy</h2>
        <p>In accordance with the principles outlined above, accessnode.cc operates a strict no-refund policy. Once an order is confirmed and the digital product is delivered or made accessible, we will not issue a refund, credit, or exchange.</p>
        <p>Refunds will be unequivocally denied for reasons including, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You changed your mind about the purchase ("buyer's remorse").</li>
            <li>You did not like the product or found it was not what you expected.</li>
            <li>You purchased the product by mistake.</li>
            <li>You do not have the appropriate software or technical ability to open or use the product.</li>
            <li>You claim the product did not produce your desired outcome or result.</li>
            <li>You found the information elsewhere or no longer need the product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is your responsibility to read the product descriptions and system requirements carefully before making a purchase to ensure it meets your needs and capabilities.</p>

        <h2>6. Exceptional Technical Issues</h2>
        <p>While our policy is strictly non-refundable, we are committed to ensuring that you receive the product you paid for in a usable condition. We recognize that rare technical faults can occur. We will consider providing assistance or, in very specific circumstances, a discretionary remedy if you encounter a verifiable and unresolvable technical issue.</p>
        <p>A valid technical issue is defined as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A purchased file is corrupted and cannot be opened or downloaded after multiple attempts using standard software.</li>
            <li>The download link or access page provided is broken and does not lead to the purchased product.</li>
            <li>An activation key or license provided does not work as intended for its specified platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To be eligible for consideration under this exception, you <strong>must contact our support team within seven (7) calendar days</strong> of the original purchase date. Our first course of action will always be to attempt to resolve the technical issue by providing a fresh download link or alternative access method. A refund will only be considered as a last resort if we are unable to provide you with a working version of the product you purchased.</p>

        <h2>7. Support Contact & Request Format</h2>
        <p>For all inquiries related to technical issues as defined in Section 6, you must contact our dedicated support channel. Do not use social media or other channels for these requests.</p>
        <p><strong>Official Support Email: <a href="mailto:support@accessnode.cc">support@accessnode.cc</a></strong></p>
        <p>To ensure a prompt and efficient review of your case, your support request must include the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The full Order Number / Transaction ID provided by our payment processor, FastSpring.</li>
            <li>The email address used to make the purchase.</li>
            <li>The exact date and approximate time of the transaction.</li>
            <li>A detailed description of the technical issue you are experiencing, including any error messages you have received.</li>
            <li>Screenshots or screen recordings that clearly demonstrate the problem are highly recommended and will expedite the resolution process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Requests that do not contain this information may be delayed or denied.</p>

        <h2>8. Dispute Resolution and Chargebacks</h2>
        <p>If you have a dispute regarding this Refund Policy, we strongly encourage you to contact our support team first to seek a resolution. We believe that most disagreements can be resolved amicably through direct communication.</p>
        <p>Initiating a payment dispute or "chargeback" with your bank or credit card company without first contacting us to resolve a technical issue is considered a breach of our Terms of Service. A chargeback is a costly and time-consuming process for both parties. We maintain detailed logs of IP addresses, access times, and download records to contest fraudulent chargebacks.</p>
        <p>Users who initiate a chargeback without a valid, unresolved technical issue may be permanently banned from making future purchases on accessnode.cc and may be added to a global fraud prevention database used by other digital merchants.</p>

        <h2>9. Agreement Confirmation & Final Legal Notice</h2>
        <p>This Refund Policy is a legally binding component of our Terms of Service. You are required to acknowledge and agree to this Policy before you can complete a purchase on our Site, typically via a checkbox at checkout.</p>
        <p>You cannot use a claim of not having read this Policy as a basis for a refund request or dispute. The act of completing a transaction on our platform constitutes a clear and binding acceptance of every clause contained within this document.</p>
        <div class="disclaimer-box">
            <h3>Final Agreement</h3>
            <p><strong>By completing a purchase on accessnode.cc, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to this Refund Policy in full. You acknowledge that our Products are digital, non-returnable, and exempt from statutory refund rights under applicable international laws once performance has begun.</strong></p>
