        <h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>The Service consists of providing access to and delivery of non-tangible, irrevocable digital products, including but not limited to structured psychological guidance systems, analytical reports, courses, and documents in formats such as PDF (the "Products"). The Products are intended for personal, educational, and informational purposes only.</p>

You acknowledge that the Service is fully rendered once the digital Product is made accessible to you.</p>
        <div class="disclaimer-box">
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:</strong> The Service and all its Products are not a substitute for professional medical, psychological, or psychiatric advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
